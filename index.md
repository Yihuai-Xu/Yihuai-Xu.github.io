## About Me

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student in [School of Data Science and Engineering](https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/) of [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) and a member of [DI DaSE](https://decisionintelligence.github.io/index), advised by Prof.[Chenjuan Guo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=WMXNm88AAAAJ) and A/Prof.[Yang 
Shu](https://shuyang96.github.io). My reasearch interests focus on Time Series Analysis based on Deep Learning, including forecasting, classification, time series fundation model, large language model for time series, multi-modal time series model.  -->

<!-- - **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->
