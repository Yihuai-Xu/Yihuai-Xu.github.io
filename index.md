## About Me
I received my Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Science from Hangzhou Normal University (Advisor: [Prof. Yu Xia](https://sxxy.hznu.edu.cn/c/2021-08-11/2574064.shtml)) in 2022 and Zhejiang Gongshang University (Advisor: [Prof. Lihui Peng](https://yjszs.zjgsu.edu.cn/2021/0616/c1697a89807/page.htm)) in 2025, respectively. 
Over the past year, I have been working as a research intern in the team of [Prof. Fei Wu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/wufei) at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Yongwei Wang](https://enkiwang.github.io/). My research primarily focuses on **AIGC authentication and forensics, particularly the detection of LLM-generated texts**.
I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position. If you are interested in my research profile, I would be delighted to connect via email for potential discussions or collaborations.

<!-- I am a Ph.D. student in [School of Data Science and Engineering](https://dase.ecnu.edu.cn/) of [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) and a member of [DI DaSE](https://decisionintelligence.github.io/index), advised by Prof.[Chenjuan Guo](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=WMXNm88AAAAJ) and A/Prof.[Yang 
Shu](https://shuyang96.github.io). My reasearch interests focus on Time Series Analysis based on Deep Learning, including forecasting, classification, time series fundation model, large language model for time series, multi-modal time series model.  -->

<!-- - **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning -->
